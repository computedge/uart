# uart

The UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) core provides serial
communication capabilities, which allow communication with modem or other external
devices, like another computer using a serial cable and RS232 protocol. This core is
designed to be maximally compatible with the industry standard National
Semiconductors’ 16550A device.
Features:
• AMBA APB interface in 32-bit or 8-bit data bus modes (selectable)
• FIFO only operation
• Register level and functionality compatibility with NS16550A (but not 16450).
• Debug Interface in 32-bit data bus mode.
